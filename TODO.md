# Daily Coding Problem

#### 2020-02-17 Binary-tree locking

This is still O(2^h) not O(h).

#### 2020-02-11 Subset max

Can't figure out a solution better than O(k lg k) ~ O (n lg n)

#### 2020-02-06 Longest-distict substring

Is there a solution faster than O(n^2)? What would a dynamic programming solution look like? Can 
this be implemented using semi-rings?
